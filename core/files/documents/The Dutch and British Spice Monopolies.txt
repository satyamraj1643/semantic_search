Following the initial Portuguese and Spanish voyages, the 17th century saw the rise of a new, more ruthless form of commercial power: the chartered trading company. The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, became the most dominant player in the spice trade. With its own ships, armies, and the authority to wage war, the VOC systematically and violently seized control of the most valuable spice-producing territories.

The most notorious example was their conquest of the Banda Islands, the world's only source of nutmeg and mace. The VOC established a brutal monopoly, decimating the local population and enslaving the survivors to work on nutmeg plantations. Their goal was to control supply so tightly that they could dictate prices across the globe. Soon after, the British East India Company rose as a major rival, focusing its efforts largely on controlling the pepper trade in India and expanding its influence. This era of corporate colonialism was defined by conflict, exploitation, and the immense concentration of wealth and power in the hands of these state-backed companies, which laid the groundwork for future European empires.
