By the late 18th century, the extraordinary value of spices began to wane. Several factors contributed to this decline. The primary cause was the breaking of monopolies. The French successfully smuggled clove and nutmeg seedlings from the Dutch-controlled Spice Islands and established new plantations on their own colonial islands, such as Mauritius. The British likewise expanded cultivation in their territories. With multiple sources of supply, prices inevitably began to fall.

Furthermore, European tastes and economies were changing. New colonial commodities like sugar, coffee, tea, and chocolate became the fashionable luxuries, displacing spices as the ultimate status symbol. The Industrial Revolution created new forms of wealth and new industries, shifting economic focus away from agricultural commodities. While spices remained an important part of global trade, they were no longer the engine of exploration and empire they had once been. They completed their long journey from a rare treasure worth more than gold to an everyday item found in nearly every kitchen on Earth.
