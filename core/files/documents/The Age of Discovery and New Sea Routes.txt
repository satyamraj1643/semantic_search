The 15th century marked a pivotal turning point in the spice trade. Frustrated by the high prices enforced by the Venetian-Arab monopoly, European powers, particularly Portugal and Spain, invested heavily in maritime exploration. Their goal was clear: to bypass the traditional overland routes and establish direct sea access to the spice-rich lands of the East.

This ambition fueled the Age of Discovery. In 1498, the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama successfully rounded Africa's Cape of Good Hope and reached the coast of India, a monumental achievement that shattered the old trade monopolies. For the first time, a European nation had a direct line to the source of black pepper and other valuable spices. Not long before, Christopher Columbus, sailing for Spain in 1492, sought a westward route to the Indies but instead stumbled upon the Americas. While he didn't find the spices he sought, his voyages introduced new plants to the world, including chili peppers, which would go on to revolutionize global cuisine. This era of exploration forever altered global maps and trade dynamics, shifting the center of economic power from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.
