The quest for spices is as old as civilization itself. For millennia, spices like cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg were as valuable as gold, driving economies and shaping empires. The earliest spice trade was dominated by Arab merchants who controlled the overland routes, including the famous Silk Road, from the spice-producing lands of India, China, and the "Spice Islands" (the Moluccas in modern-day Indonesia) to the markets of the Middle East.
These merchants carefully guarded the secrets of their sources, inventing fantastical stories of monsters and dangers to deter rivals. From bustling Levantine ports, spices were then sold to Venetian and Genoese traders, who held a lucrative monopoly on the European trade. The immense cost of this long and perilous journey, with goods changing hands multiple times, made spices a symbol of extreme wealth and status for the European elite. This Roman and later European dependency on the Arab and Venetian middlemen set the stage for a dramatic shift in world history, as nations began to dream of finding their own direct sea route to the source.
