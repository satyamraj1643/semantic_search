Long before they were common kitchen ingredients, spices played a central role in medicine, spiritual rituals, and even magic. In ancient Egypt, cinnamon and myrrh were essential for the sacred process of embalming. In Europe, medical practice was dominated by the Greek theory of the four humors, which held that health depended on the balance of four bodily fluids. Spices were considered "hot" and "dry" and were prescribed to counteract "cold" and "wet" ailments like coughs and colds.

Clove oil was a universal remedy for toothaches, while nutmeg was carried in pomanders as a supposed protection against the Black Death. Spices were also believed to have aphrodisiac qualities, making them popular ingredients in love potions. Their intoxicating aromas made them a key component of religious incense, used in ceremonies from Catholic High Mass to Buddhist temple rituals, symbolizing a fragrant offering to the divine. This deep mystical and medicinal significance helps explain why spices were valued so highly, far beyond their ability to simply flavor food.
