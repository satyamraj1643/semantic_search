The European discovery of the Americas in 1492 initiated a massive ecological and cultural transfer known as the Columbian Exchange. While Christopher Columbus failed to find the Asian spices he sought, the exchange introduced a whole new category of flavorings to the Old World. Chief among these was the chili pepper. Originating in the Americas, it was quickly adopted and spread by Portuguese traders along their African and Asian trade routes, revolutionizing cuisines from Hungary (in paprika) to Thailand.

Beyond chilies, the New World gave the globe two other major flavorings: vanilla, derived from an orchid in Mesoamerica, and allspice, from a Caribbean tree whose berries tasted like a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Unlike the spices of the East, which took centuries to become globally known, these new flavors spread with unprecedented speed. The Columbian Exchange was a two-way street, but in terms of spices, the Americas provided a new and potent arsenal of tastes that fundamentally and permanently altered the world's palate.
