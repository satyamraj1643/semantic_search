For centuries before the Age of Discovery, the Republic of Venice was the undisputed master of the European spice trade. Strategically positioned on the Adriatic, Venetian merchants built an immense maritime and commercial empire by acting as the primary European intermediary for goods arriving from the Levant. They cultivated exclusive trading relationships with the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, who controlled the endpoints of the overland caravan routes from the East.

This arrangement created a powerful dual monopoly. Arab traders controlled the supply to the Mediterranean, and the Venetians controlled the distribution within Europe. The wealth generated from this trade was staggering, funding the magnificent art and architecture of the Renaissance in Venice. The Republic's galleys, protected by a formidable navy, transported peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon up the Adriatic, from where they were sold at enormous profit to merchants across Europe. This chokehold on the most valuable trade in the world was the primary economic motivation for Portugal and Spain to fund risky voyages into the unknown, hoping to break Venice's grip.
